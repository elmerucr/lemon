## Building with CMake

Create a build directory in the source tree ```mkdir build```, run ```cmake ..``` from that directory and run ```make```. Alternatively do ```mkdir Debug```, run ```cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..``` from that directory and run ```make```.

Below some more OS specific intructions on how to prepare the build environment.

### MacOS specific

* Install Xcode from App Store
* When it asks to install command line tools, do that
* Install Homebrew
* From the Homebrew command line, install cmake and SDL2 libraries

### Ubuntu / Debian specific
